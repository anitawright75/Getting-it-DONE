This is a MEAN stack task list web application.  I used the information found on Brad Traversy's YouTube tutorial MEAN App From Scratch - MongoDB, Express, Angular 2 & NodeJS. 

This is a very basic application and I plan on tweaking a few things, especially the Angular side of things.  Since the tutorial was made, Angular 2 has rolled out some pretty significant updates.  I plan on re-coding the client side using the new updates.  I may also add a few additional features, (ability to add to calendar, ability to set up recurring lists) but I will see.
